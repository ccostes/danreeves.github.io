My personal project for the last week has been building my new personal site.

I wanted to building something with the capability of blogging while being simple, light-weight and modern. Instead of opting for the typical, bloated, choices I decided on using the flat file CMS [Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/). Pico allows me to create content as markdown files, and power the whole site using the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating engine.

The great thing about Pico is it's Open Source and easily extensible. There are already a few [plugins written for Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/plugins.html) by different people. None matched exactly what I wanted, so I wrote my own: [Picotags](https://github.com/HeyDanReeves/picotags). Picotags extends the page meta functionality of Pico to allow a `Tags` meta attribute. Pages can then be tagged and sorted by these tags, for example this post is tagged under [php](/tag/php) and [cms](/tag/cms).

	Title: New site, powered by Pico
	Description: Hey! I'm Dan Reeves, a web developer and hacker.

	Robots: index,follow

	Date: 2013/10/06
	Tags: php,cms

These tags can then be accessed though the Twig template tags `meta.tags` and each `page.tags` in the `pages` array.

	{% if meta.tags %}
		<ul class="tags">
		{% for tag in meta.tags %}
			<li><a href="{{ base_url }}/tag/{{ tag }}">{{ tag }}</a></li>
		{% endfor %}
		</ul>
	{% endif %}

One of my favourite parts of this set up is that all my content is stored in a nice open format, Markdown. All my pages and blog posts are easily reusable unlike content tied up in a database. It also means creating the content can be easily done anywhere and in any editor. I'm currently using [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) which gives me a nice preview as I type, but I could just as easily use my main code editor ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) or various smartphone or web based apps to write it.

###Colophon

While I'm here I should probably mention the other technologies I've used to create this site.

The font used is [Omnes Pro by Darden Studio](http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes_pro). This webfont is powered by [TypeKit](https://typekit.com/).

The css is all written by me but starts with the great [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and I'm using the aptly named [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

For flexible headers I have used the jQuery-free fork of [FitText.js](https://github.com/adactio/FitText.js) by [@adactio](https://twitter.com/adactio).

For syntax highlighting in code examples I decided to go with [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/). This allowed me to leave the backend parsing of the markdown files alone, as it automatically finds blocks of code, detects the language, and highlights it accordingly.

###Open Web

Openess is one of the most important parts of the web and it feels good to be using and contributing to that. I learnt almost everything I know about the web from other peoples contributions and reading code so I know I have a lot to give back. In that vein, my Pico Tags plugin is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/HeyDanReeves) and I'm planning on keeping all of my source code for this site, for those that want to see how I made it, and all my blog posts up there too. Everything will be under the [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) so help yourself!
